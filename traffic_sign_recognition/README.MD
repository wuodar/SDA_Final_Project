## Dataset Relevant Information Paragraph
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification dataset. It contains more than 50k images and 43 classes of traffic signs. The dataset can be used for classification, as well as detection problems (annotations contains coordinates of the bounding boxes indicating position of the signs).

## Task description
The task is to build a model that classify what class of traffic sign is present on the image. Remember to explore the dataset, check if it's, for example, balanced, or not. Try with something simple, then try to change the transforms, model architectures or hyperparameters.
